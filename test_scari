        disease before we, The American People, must declare preemptive war on

        signing a blood oath to forget that WMD were not a Grave and Gathering

            Reality has not been kind to either Karl Rove or his Puppet, Georgie 
            The Younger. Dick Cheney is still out there lurking, Donald Rumsfeld 
            has just about warn out his glibness and Paul Wolfowitz has slipped 
            from sight. Richard Perle is still convinced of the rectitude of his 
            certitude and we get the bill for all this duplicity &#150;&#150;

            </b> Seymour Hersh and our national security authenticity, New Yorker, 
            Oct 27.03 brings clarity to murky spin. Praise to investigative reporting. 
            Why is Seymour not poisoned yet? He has single-handedly circumnavigated 
            the darkest administration seen since Nixon. <br>
            <b><font size="4">Talking points:</font></b> 6/2003<br>
            &quot;It is regrettable that plausible deniability is insufficient 
            in cases like these and deniable plausibility may become the norm 
            in future discussion&quot; &#150;&#150; by decree &#150;&#150; beside 
            taking the 5th, rather, failure to recall &#150;&#150; absence of

            <b>&quot;Keep you eye on the Ball&quot;</b><br>
            We all should remember, we should. On the eve of Gulf War II during 
            the Senate Hearing on war powers for the use of preemptive force. 
            Joe Biden said again and again, &quot;KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL.&quot; 
            It was a simple request, keep your eye on the ball. But we, the public, 
            watched as this, unfairly elected, administration double dribbled, 
            clipped, barged at the mark and stepped out of bounds -- yes Joe Biden 
            made a simple request of us and we let him down. <br>
            Now months later we are busy looking stupid. Bush looks dumb (as usual), 
            Rumsfeld is talking of a slog and preemption engineered by Cheney 
            and his supplicants have forced us to suffer babbling sycophantic 
            platitudes and we, the willfully ignorant, allow the justice of Ashcroft 
            to reign supreme while we send, get well, cards to Rush Limbaugh; 
            the babbling talking head of heads. Meanwhile, like Dr. Henry Kissinger, 
            Dr. Condoleezza Rice, the academic pragmatist, spins and spins a dervish 
            credible to no one -- let her fall on here swords too. <br>
            Why are we, the unwashed, convinced we are in the final daze of Pax 
            Amerika?<br>
